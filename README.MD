This is a Node.js script designed to simulate a password reset request to Instagram using the Instagram API.

## Features
- Takes either a username or email address as input.
- Generates random data to simulate a password reset request.
- Sends a POST request to Instagramâ€™s API to initiate the password reset process.
- Outputs response from Instagram's API.
